# Chord Switching - Metronome for Improving Chord Changes

Chord Switching is an open-source web application designed to assist beginners in guitar and ukulele in improving their chord switching speed effectively and enjoyable. It originated from the developer's personal experience of purchasing a guitar and wanting to learn how to play it, but struggling with the speed of chord changes.

## Key Features

- Customizable chord configuration: Chord Switching allows you to choose the specific chords you want to practice with. There is no limit to the number of chords you can add.
- Tempo control: Set the BPM (beats per minute) for the metronome.
- Chord change intervals: You can configure the BPM intervals at which each chord will be played. For example, every 3 BPM, the next chord will be executed.
- Speed increment: With each cycle of the selected chord list, you can gradually increase the BPM according to your preferences. This will help you develop speed and fluency in chord transitions.
- Reverse mode: In addition to the standard mode where chords are played in the chosen sequence, Chord Switching offers a reverse mode where chords are played in reverse order.
